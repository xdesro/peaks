# Peaks

A list of 14ers in Colorado I have climbed :)

## üöß Setup and Local Dev

1. Install dependencies.
   ```sh
   npm i
   ```
2. Run for local development. Kicks off a _(mostly)_ hot-reloading server at `localhost:8080`.
   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```
3. Build for deployment.
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Things To Note

- Everything in that `initial` repo is just leftover from me converting an HTML table list of 14ers I found online to JSON structured in the format I need. The actual data the app consumes is in `src/_data/mountains.json`. I left `initial` there just in case I need to reset the project or something lol.
